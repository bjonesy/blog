  I had a recent situation where I was unable to use the  Autoprefixer plugin,
  in a project I was working on, to manually add CSS vendor prefixes for me. I
  learned that the  Autoprefixer plugin has an online interactive demo page
  which I used to help me manually add these vendor prefixes.
category: CSS
tags:
  - CSS
  - Autoprefixer

If you have used any of the modern frameworks like Angular or React you might be familiar with the PostCSS plugin Autoprefixer. It is a great plugin that will use data based on current browser popularity and property support to apply vendor prefixes to your styles for you. This can be a big help if you use something like CSS grid to allow your CSS grid styles to fallback in older browsers like Internet Explorer.

But what if you are in a situation where you need to manually do this or you are working on a project where you are unable to use this plugin. I came across this situation recently and did not know that the Autoprefixer plugin has an interactive online demo page that I could use to help me. [Autoprefixer online demo](https://autoprefixer.github.io/). 

In my situation this online interactive demo was very helpful and helped me correctly update my styles to include the correct vendor prefixes.
